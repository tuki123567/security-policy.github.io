# Security & Privacy Policy

This Jira app (“the App”) is developed and maintained by an individual developer.  
The App provides simple Earned Value Management (EVM) visualization inside Jira.  
All operations are performed on a best-effort basis.

---

## 1. Data Access and Storage
- The App runs on **Atlassian Forge**, inside Forge’s secure sandbox environment.
- The App only reads Jira issue data required to calculate and display EVM metrics.
- **No customer data is stored** on external servers.
- **No data is transmitted** outside Atlassian’s infrastructure.
- The App does not collect or store personally identifiable information (PII).

---

## 2. Data Transmission
All communication between the App and Atlassian APIs is performed securely over HTTPS, using Atlassian’s built-in mechanisms.

---

## 3. Permissions
The App requests only the minimum permissions required to function:

- `read:jira-work`
- `read:project:jira`

No administrative or unnecessary permissions are requested.

---

## 4. Security Practices
- The App benefits from the isolation and protections provided by the **Forge runtime sandbox**.
- Dependencies are reviewed and updated when necessary.
- Security issues reported by users will be addressed on a best-effort basis.

---

## 5. Use of External Services
The App may use the following external services:

- **GitHub Pages** for hosting this policy
- **Google Gmail** for receiving support inquiries

Any security incident or operational issue originating from those external services is **outside our control**, and we are not responsible for their behavior, uptime, or data handling.

---

## 6. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:

- We provide this App **“as is” without warranties** of any kind.
- We are **not liable** for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use of the App.
- Users access and use the App **at their own risk**.

This limitation of liability applies regardless of the nature of any potential issue, including bugs, failures, service outages, or security incidents.

---

## 7. Updates to This Policy
This policy may be updated at any time without prior notice.  
The most recent version will always be published on this site or repository.
